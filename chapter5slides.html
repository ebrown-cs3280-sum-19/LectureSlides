					## Problem Solving ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Algorithms ###

					* Any computing problem can be solved by executing a series of **actions** in a specific **order**
					* These actions in a specific order is called an algorithm
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Pseudocode ###

					* informal language that helps you develop algorithms without worrying about syntax
					* psuedocode isn't a formal language and you can define your own
					* come up with whatever style helps you but try to be consistent
					* you can use plain language or something that is closer to code
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					plain-English psudocode (no variable assignments)

					```[psuedocode]
					Prompt user for integer
					Input the first integer

					prompt the user for integer
					Input the second integer

					Add first integer and second integer
					Display result
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					more "code-like" psudocode

					```[psudocode]
					integer1 = user input
					integer2 = user input
					result = integer1 + integer2
					display result
					```
				</section>

					## Control Statements ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Structural Programming ###

					* in the 60s it was common to use `goto` statement
					* ths cause a logt of difficulty among software developers
					* a `goto` could transfer control almost anywhere in the code
					* Bohm and Jacopini research showed that they could write code without `goto` statements
					* this discipline of not using `goto` statements is called *structured programming*
					* this sped up development times and kept budgets
					* they also showed that you could write all programs with only 3 types of control structures
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Sequence Structure ###

					Basic structure where each statement is executed one after the other in the order they are written.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Selection Structures ###

					* 3 different types of selection statements
					* `if` statement performs the action if a condition is true
					* `if` `else` performs an action if a condition is true or performs a different action if it's false
					* `switch` statement performs one of many different actions depending on the value of an expression 
					<aside class="notes">
						switch statements and big if-else trees can be hard to read so should be kept away from higher level code
					</aside>
				</section>
			</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Selection Statements ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### If Single-Selection Statement ###

					Psudocode if statement
					
					```[psudocode]
					If student’s grade is greater than or equal to 60
						Display “Passed”
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					c# if statement

					```[C#]
					if (studentGrade >= 60)
					{
						Console.WriteLine("Passed");
					}
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Psudocode if...else statement

					```[psudocode]
					If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
							Display "Passed"
					Else
							Display "Failed"
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					C# if...else statement

					```[C#]
					if (grade >= 60)
					{
						Console.WriteLine("Passed");
					}
					else
					{
						Console.WriteLine("Failed");
					}
					```
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Iteration Statements ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### `while` iteration statement ###

					Psudocode while loop
					
					```[psudocode]
					While there are more items on my shopping list
						Purchase next item and cross it off my list
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					C# while loop

					```[C#]
					int product = 3;
					while (product <= 100)
					{
						product = 3 * product;
					}
					```
					More on iteration statements in chapter 6
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Assignments ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Conditional Operator ###

					* `?:` can be used in place of an `if..else` statement
					* c#'s only ternary operator
					* takes 3 operands
					* `bool-expression ? true-value : false-value`
					
					```[C#]
					Console.WriteLine(studentGrade >= 60 ? "Passed" : "Failed");
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Compound Assignment Operators ###

					Abbreviate assignment operations like this:
					
					`variable = variable operator expression;`
					
					to
					
					`variable operator= expression;`
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					for example:

					`c = c + 3;`
					
					using the compund assignment operator
					
					`c += 3`
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					The `+=` adds the value of the expression on its right to the variable on it's left and stores it in the variable on the left

					other compound assignment operators:
					
					* `+=`
					* `-=`
					* `*=`
					* `/=`
					* `%=`
