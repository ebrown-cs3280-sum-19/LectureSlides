				<h1>Chapter 7 - Methods</h1>
			</section>
			<section>

					## Packaging Code in C# ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Modularizing Programs ###

					* Methods (functions or procedures) allow you to modularize an app by separating task into self-contained units
					* Usually, **method** refers to a **function** associated with an object but for the most part **function** and **method** are interchangeable
					* methods are essentially smaller programs inside a larger program that can be reused
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Calling Methods ###

					* Methods are invoked by a method call
					* When a method completes, it returns control and possibly a result to its caller
					```[C#]
					result = objectOne.Method1();
					```
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## `static` Keyword ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### `static` Methods ###

					* Not all methods are reliant on an object's data to perform it's task
					* These methods can be `static` methods meaning you can call them in their `class` rather than in an instantiated object from that `class`
					
					```[C#]
					ClassName.MethodName(arguments);
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### `static` Variables ###

					* `static` variables are variables that associated with a class and not to any instances of that class
					* If you have a static variable in a class then instantiate an instance of that class, that static variable will have the same value for all instances of the class
					
					```[C#]
					MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
					Debug.Assert(myClass.SomeStaticVariable == MyClass.SomeStaticVariable); // is true
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### `static` Class ###

					* `static` classes are classes that can't be instantiated
					* They can only contain static data members and methods
					* they sealed, meaning you cannot inherit a static class from another class
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### C# `Math` Class ###

					* `Math` is part of the `System` namespace
					* Provides a collection of methods that perform mathematical calculations
					
					```[C#]
					double value = Math.Sqrt(900.0); // Static method call
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Some Static Methods in `Math`
					
					* `Abs(x)` absolute value
					* `Ceiling(x)` Rounds up to next int
					* `Floor(x)` Round down to next int
					* `Cos(x)`, `Sin(x)`, `Tan(x)` Trigonmetric functions
					* `Pow(x, y)` raise x to power of y
					* `Log(x)` natural log
					* and more...
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Static Variables ###

					* Static variables are associated with the class they are in not any object instantiated from that class
					* All instances of the class will share the static variables in it
					* `Math` has two static `double` constants that are common math values:
						* `Math.PI`
						* `Math.E`
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### `static` Main ###

					Why is main declared static?
					During app startup, no objects of the class have been created, the `Main` method must be called to begin program execution.
					Declaring `Main` as `static` allows the execution environment to call `Main` without creating an instance of the class
				</section>
			</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Calling Methods ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Three Ways to Call a Method ###

					1. Using a method name by itself to call a method of the same class
					2. Using a reference to an object, followed by the member-access operator (`.`) and the method name to call non-`static` method of referenced object
					3. Using the class name and the `.` operator to call a `static` method of a class
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Method Example ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Maximum Method ###

					```[C#]
					class Maximum Finder
					{
						static void Main()
						{
							// static methods can directly call other static methods in the same clas
							double result = Maximum(2.0, 4.1, 1.1);
							Console.WriteLine(result); // prints 4.1
						}
						static double Maximum(double x, double y, double z)
						{
							double maximumValue = x;
							if (y > maximumValue)
							{
								maximumValue = y;
							}
							if (z > maximumValue)
							{
								maximumValue = z;
							}
							return maximumValue
						}
					}
					```
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Method-Call Stack ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					* LIFO - Last In First Out
					* **Push** on top to add, **pop** off the top to remove
					* Sometimes referred to as the program-execution stack
					* Works behind the scenes to support the method call/return mechanism
					* It holds each called method's local variables
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Stack Frames ###

					* As a method is called it may call another method
					* The last called method needs to return before the previously called method can finish
					* When a method calls another method an entry is **pushed** on the stack
					* This entry are called **stack frame** or **activation record**
					* Contains the return address that the called method needs in order to return to the calling method
					* When a method finishes the stack frame is **popped** and it transfers control to the return address in the popped stack frame
					* A method always can find information it needs at the top of the call stack
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Local Variables and Stack Frames ###

					* Stack frames contain local variables for the method
					* Local variables only exist while a method is executing
					* They persist on the stack when another method is called
					* When a method finishes it's frame is **popped** and garbage collections reclaims the memory
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Stack Overflow ###

					* You can run out of memory if too much is placed on the stack
					* This is called **stack overflow**
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Method Overloading ##

					* Methods of the same name in the same class, as long as they have different sets of parameters
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					```[c#]
					// square method with int argument
					static int Square(int intValue)
					{
						Console.WriteLine($"Called square with int argument: {intValue}");
						return intValue * intValue;
					}

					// square method with double argument
					static double Square(double doubleValue)
					{
						Console.WriteLine(
							$"Called square with double argument: {doubleValue}");
						return doubleValue * doubleValue;
					}
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					* The compiler distiguishes overloaded methods by their **signature**.
					* The signature is a combination of the method name and parameters (types and count).
					* Its return type is not consider in distinguishing overloaded methods.
					
					```[c#]
					void Method1(int a, float b)
					```
					
					```[c#]
					void Method1(float a, int b)
					```
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Optional Parameters ##

					* Allows a varying amount of arguments when calling a method
					* Optional parameters have a default value that is assignged if the optional argument isn't passed in
					
					```[C#]
					static int Power(int baseValue, int exponentValue = 2)
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Named Parameters ###

					```[C#]
					public void SetTime(int hour = 0, int minute = 0, int second = 0)
					```
					
					* `t.SetTime() // SetTime(0, 0, 0)`
					* `t.SetTime(12) // SetTime(12, 0, 0)`
					* `t.SetTime(12, 30) // SetTime(12, 30, 0)`
					* `t.SetTime(12, 30, 22) // SetTime 12, 30, 22`
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					How can you set just some of the arguments?
					
					```[C#]
					t.SetTime(12, , 22); // COMPILATION ERROR
					```
					
					* `t.SetTime(hour:12, second: 22) // SetTime(12, 0, 22)`
					* `t.SetTime(minute: 30) // SetTime(0, 30, 0)`
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Expression Bodied Methods and Properties ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					```[C#]
					static int Cube(int x)
					{
						return x * x * x;
					}
					```
					
					to
					
					```[C#]
					static int Cube(int x) => x * x * x;
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					* This can be with `static` and non-`static` methods
					* `return` types are not required either
					
					```[C#]
					static void PrintSomething(string something) => Console.WriteLine(something);
					```
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Recursion ##

					A **recursive method** is a method that calls itself
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Base Cases and Recursive Calls ###

					* Only capable of solving only the simplest case(s) (**base cases**)
					* Divides the problem in two coneptual pieces (**divide and conquer**)
					* A piece that the method knows how to do and piece it doesn't know yet
					* The later piece must resemble the original problem just simpler and smaller
					* Because it resembles the problem the method can call itself to solve it
					* This is called the **recursion step** or **recursive call**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Recursive Factorial Calculation ###

					* n! = `n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1`
					* 1! is equal to 1
					* 0! is equal to 1
					* 5! is 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 120
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Nonrecursive implemnation

					```[C#]
					long factorial = 1;
					
					for (long counter = number; counter >= 1; --counter)
					{
						factorial *= counter;
					}
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					```[C#]
					static long Factorial(long number)
					{
						// base case
						if (number <= 1)
						{
							return 1;
						}
						else // recursion step
						{
							return number * Factorial(number - 1);
						}
					}
					```
				</section>

					## Value vs Reference ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Passing Arguments ###

					* Pass arguments to method using **pass-by-value** or **pass-by-reference**
					* by value 
						* a copy of its value is made and passed into the called method
						* changes made to the copy do not affect the original
					* by reference
						* the caller gives the method the ability to access and modify the original variable
						* changes made affect the original
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Value vs Reference Types ###

					* Value Types - `int`, `double` and `decimal`
					* A variable of a value type contain a value of that type
					* Reference Types - refers to an object
					* A variable of a reference type contain a location where the data is stored
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### `ref` and `out` Parameters ###

					* `ref` keyword on a parameter declaration allows you to pass a varible by reference
					* `out` creates an **output parameter** that allows the method to write to that variable						
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					```[C#]
					// x is passed as a reference
					static void Square(ref int x) {
						x = x * x;
					}
					
					// value of x is available to caller
					static void Square(out int x) {
						x = 6;
						x = x * x;
					}
					
					// x value dies with the method
					static void square(int x) {
						x = x * x;
					}
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					```[C#]
					static void Main() {
						// display original values of y and z
						Console.WriteLine($"Original value of y: {y}");
						Console.WriteLine("Original value of z: uninitialized\n");
					
						// pass y and z by reference
						SquareRef(ref y); // must use keyword ref
						SquareOut(out z); // must use keyword out
					
						// display values of y and z after they’re modified by
						// methods SquareRef and SquareOut, respectively
						Console.WriteLine($"Value of y after SquareRef: {y}");
						Console.WriteLine($"Value of z after SquareOut: {z}\n");
					
						// pass y and z by value
						Square(y);
						Square(z);
					
						// display values of y and z after they’re passed to method Square
						// to demonstrate that arguments passed by value are not modified
						Console.WriteLine($"Value of y after Square: {y}");
						Console.WriteLine($"Value of z after Square: {z}");
					}
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					```[output]
					Original value of y: 5
					Original value of z: uninitialized
					
					Value of y after SquareRef: 25
					Value of z after SquareOut: 36
					
					Value of y after Square: 25
					Value of z after Square: 36
					```
