					## Introduction ##

					* Polymorphism enables us to program in the general rather than in the specific
					* enables us to write apps that process objects that share the *same* base class
					* You can send the same "message" to many different objects and each one will respond appropriately based on their implementation
					* allows systems to be designed that are easily *extensible*
					* Adding another sub class is simple, all the portions that process the base class remain the same
				</section>
			</section>

					## Polymorphism Example ##
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### **Quadrilateral** Inheritance Hierarchy ###

					* if claa `Rectangle` is derived from a class `Quadrilateral` then `Rectangle` *is a* specific version of `Quadrilateral`
					* Any operation (e.g., calculating perimeter or area) that can be performed on `Quadrilateral` also can be performed on `Rectangle`
					* **Polymorphism** occurs when a program invokes a method through a base-class variable--at execution time
					* the correct derived-class version of the class method is called, based on the type of the referenced object
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Software Engineering Observation 12.1 ###

					Polymorphism promotes extensibility: Software that invokes polymorphic behavior is independent of the object types to which messages are sent.
					New object types that can respond to existing method calls can be incorporated into a system without requiring modification of the polymorphic system logic.
					Only client code that instantiates new objects must be modified to accommodate new types.

					### Software Engineering Observation 12.3 ###

					A base-class variable that contains a reference to a derived-class object and is used to call a virtual method actually calls the overriding derived-class version of the method
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Abstract Classes and Methods ##

					* When we think of a class type, we assume that apps will create objects of that type
					* In some cases, however, it’s useful to declare classes for which you never intend to instantiate objects
					* These classes are called **abstract classes**
					* They're only used as base classes
					* They *cannot* be used to instantiate objects, because they are *incomplete*
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Purpose of an Abstract Class ###

					* provide a base class from which other classes can inherit to *share a common design*
					* common attributes and behviors are shared
					* classes that can be used to instantiate objects are called **concrete classes**
					* such classes provide implementations of *every* method they declare
					* abstract classes are too *general* to create real objects
					* We need more to be *specific* before we can create objects
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Client Code That Uses Only Abstract Base-Class Types ###

					* You'll often write client code that uses only abstract base-class types to reduce client code dependencies on a range of specific derived-class types
					* for example, you can write a method with a parameter of an abstract base-class type, then when called it can be passes an object of any concrete class that extends the abstract base class
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Creating an Abstract Class ###

					* You make a class abstract by declaring it with the keyworkd `abstract`
					* they normally contain one or more `abstract` methods
						* `public abstract void Draw(); // abstract method`
					* *Abstract methods are implicitly virtual and do not provide implementations*
					* A class that contains abstract methods must be declared as an abstract class even if it contains some concrete methods
					* concrete derived class's must provide concrete implementations of the base class's abstract methods
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Abstract Properties ###

					* Properties also can be declared `abstract` or `virtual`, then overridden in derived classes with the `override` keyword
					* this allows abstract base class to spcify common properties of its derived classes
					* `public abstract PropertyType MyProperty { get; set; }`
					* the semicolons after `get` and `set` indicate we provide *no implementations* for the accessors
					* Concrete derived classes must provide implementations for *every* accessor declared inthe abstract property
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Constructors and `static` Methods Cannot be `abstract` or `virtual` ###

					* Constructors and static methods cannot be declared abstract or virtual.
					* Constructors are not inherited, so such a constructor could never be implemented.
					* Similarly, derived classes cannot override static methods, so such as static method could never be implemented.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Common Programming Error 12.2 ###

					Failure to implement a base class’s abstract methods and properties in a derived class is a compilation error unless the derived class is also declared abstract.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Declaring Variables of Abstract Base Class Types ###

					* Although we cannot instantiate objects of `abstract` base classes, you can use `abstract` base classes to declare variables
					* these varibales can hold references to objects of any concrete classes derived from those `abstract` classes
					* Apps typically use such variables to manipulate derived-class objects polymorphically
					* You can use `abstract` base-class names to invoke `static` methods declared in those `abstract` base classes

					### Common Programming Error 12.3 ###

					Assigning a base-class variable to a derived-class variable (without an explicit downcast) is a compilation error

				## `sealed` Methods and Classes ##

				* Only methods declared `virtual`, `override` or `abstract` can be overridden in derived classes
				* A method declared `sealed` in a base class cannot be overridden in a derivded class
				* `private` methods are implicitly `sealed` because it's impossible to override them in a derived class
				* the derived class can declare a new method with the same signature as the `private` method in the base class
				* `static` also are implicitly `sealed`
				* `sealed` methods declaration can never change so all derived calsses use the same implementation

					## Interfaces ##

					* An interface declaration begins with the keyword interface and can contain only
						* abstract methods
						* abstract properties
						* abstract indexers
						* abstract events
					* Interface members are *implicitly* declared both `public` and `abstract`

					### Good Programming Practice 12.1 ###

					By convention, the name of an interface begins with I (e.g., IPayable). This helps distinguish interfaces from classes, improving code readability.

					### Good Programming Practice 12.2 ###

					When declaring a method in an interface, choose a name that describes the method’s purpose in a general manner, because the method may be implemented by a broad range of unrelated classes.
